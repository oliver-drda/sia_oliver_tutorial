### What is Sia?

Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform that enables users to securely store and retrieve data. It utilizes blockchain technology and a p2p network to establish a decentralized storage marketplace. Its mission is to commoditize data storage, making it affordable, ubiquitous, and accessible to all while safeguarding privacy and performance.

The goals and responsibilities of the Sia Foundation are numerous: 
- To maintain core Sia protocols and consensus code; to support developers building on top of Sia and its protocols.
- To promote Sia and facilitate partnerships in other spheres and communities.
- To ensure that users can easily acquire and safely store siacoins.
- To develop network scalability solutions.
- To implement hardforks and lead the community through them.

### What is Decentralization Storage?

Decentralized storage refers to a storage system where data is distributed across multiple nodes in a network rather than being stored in a central location. This approach offers increased security, data redundancy, and availability compared to traditional centralized storage systems.

### What is `renterd`?

`renterd` is the official renter component of the Sia network. It provides the functionality to manage files, upload and download data, and interact with the Sia network.
